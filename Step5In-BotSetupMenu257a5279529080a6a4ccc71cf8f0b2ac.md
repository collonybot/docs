# Step 5: In-Bot Setup Menu

After adding collony to your groups and starting the bot, you‚Äôll enter the in-bot setup. This menu acts as your **control panel** ‚Äì where you connect your community group, link your dashboard group, and adjust all core settings. On this page, we‚Äôll walk through each option so you know exactly where to navigate.

1. **Open Channel Setup**
    
    Select **Channel Setup** from the menu. Both your **community group** and **dashboard group** will be listed.
