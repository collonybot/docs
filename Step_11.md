# Step 11: Setup the Admin Dashboard Chat

Besides your main community chat, you‚Äôll need a separate **private Telegram group** that acts as your **collony admin dashboard**. This is where collony delivers internal alerts to your team ‚Äì deleted messages, reasons for removals, suspicious activity, and other moderation reports.

1. **Create a Private Telegram Group**
    
    Name it something clear like **[Your Project] Dashboard** and add core team members who should receive moderation updates.
    
2. **Enable Visible Chat History**
    
    In **Group Settings ‚Üí Chat History for New Members**, set history to **Visible**.

    **Required:** Chat history must be visible in **both** your main community chat and your dashboard group for collony to function properly.

**3. Add collony to the Dashboard Group**

As with your main chat, click **Add Member**, search for **@CollonyBot** (or collony.ai), and add it.

1. **How the Dashboard Works**
    
    When collony flags suspicious content, it will:
    
    - Remove the message from the main chat
    - Mute or ban the user (depending on rules)
    - Post a detailed report in your **admin** **dashboard group** with sender info, removed content, and reason for action. This way, your team has full visibility without disrupting the community experience.
