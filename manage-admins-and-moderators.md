# ğŸ«‚ Add & Manage Admins

Admins control the entire collony setup process â€” from inviting the bot to your community, to configuring the dashboard, setting rules, and adding new team members. Hereâ€™s how to assign them:

1. **Click on Manage Admin.**  
2. **Forward a message from the user.** Open a private Telegram chat with the person you want to add, then forward any of their messages to collony. This ensures collony captures their correct Telegram user ID.  
3. Once forwarded, the user will automatically be added to your admin list.

> ğŸ’¡ **Tip:** Admins can be added or removed anytime, but all have equal rights â€“ even the one who added collony can be removed. To avoid issues, keep the admin list small and limited to trusted team members.
