>  **üí° Why:** collony requires access to past messages to moderate effectively and generate accurate responses.

>  **‚ö†Ô∏è Keep in mind:** Apply this setting to every group where collony will be active ‚Äì including the dashboard group (explained later). If chat history is hidden, collony cannot review past conversations and its capabilities will be limited.
