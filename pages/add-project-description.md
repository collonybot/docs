2. **Save**

   Choose **Save** when the description looks good.
3. **Confirm**

   collony will confirm once your description is updated.

> **ðŸ’¡ Tip:** Keep it short, clear, and welcoming - it should highlight your vision while making newcomers feel oriented. If you ever want to update it, just paste a new description and send it.
