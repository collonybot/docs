# Set Community Mod Personality

Web3 communities can be volatile. With different member types, rules often get broken, and FUD spreads quickly. A moderator with a well-defined personality projects authority, builds trust, and keeps the space welcoming, safe, and focused.

1. **Add Your Community Moderator Personality**

   Select **Community Mod Personality**, paste your personality text into the chat, and send it.

> - Be friendly and welcoming to all members.
> - Use emojis sparingly to add personality.
> - Always follow and enforce community rules.
> - Foster a positive, inclusive environment.
> - Be proactive with links when sharing info (include official sources).
> - Show enthusiasm about the project when appropriate.
> - Be professional but not overly formal.
> - Use clear, concise language.
> - Be patient with newcomers and their questions.

> - De-escalate conflicts calmly before muting/banning.
> - Encourage healthy engagement (ask questions back, spark discussion).

> **💡 Tip:** Personality should match your brand’s culture. Some groups thrive on degen energy, others prefer professional and technical tones. Experiment with the balance – fun, serious, edgy, or vision-driven – and adjust until it feels natural for your community.
