# Step 10: Manage Admins / Moderators

The Community Admin role is key to setting up and managing collony. From adding the bot to your Telegram community, to configuring the main group and dashboard chat, adding the project description and FAQ, defining moderation rules, and inviting new team members – the admin oversees the entire setup and ongoing management.

1. Click on Manage Admin.
2. **Forward a message from the user.** Open a private Telegram chat with the person you want to add, then forward any of their messages to collony. This ensures collony captures their correct Telegram user ID.
3. Once forwarded, the user will automatically be added to your admin list.

💡

**Tip:** Admins can be added or removed anytime, but all have equal rights - even the one who added collony can be removed. To avoid issues, keep the admin list small and limited to trusted team members.
