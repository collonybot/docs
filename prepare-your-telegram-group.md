<Tip>
  Why: collony AI needs access to past messages to moderate effectively and generate accurate responses.
  </Tip>

<Warning>
  Keep in mind: Apply this setting to every group where collony will be active â€“ including the dashboard group (explained later). If chat history is hidden, collony cannot review past conversations and its capabilities will be limited.
