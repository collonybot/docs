# 🔩 Adjust Group Settings

Before inviting the collony AI moderator, update your Telegram group permissions so the bot can function properly:

1. Open **Group Settings** in Telegram.

2. Set **Chat history for new members → Visible**.

> 💡 **Why:** collony AI needs access to past messages to moderate effectively and generate accurate responses.  

> ⚠️ **Keep in mind:** Apply this setting to every group where collony will be active — including the dashboard group (explained later). If chat history is hidden, collony cannot review past conversations and its capabilities will be limited.
