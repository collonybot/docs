Your project description is shown when members interact with the bot. It helps onboard newcomers, clarify your mission, and build trust in your community.

1. In the setup menu, select **Project Description**.
2. Enter a clear, concise overview of your project – what it is, what it does, and why people should care.
3. Save your changes.
