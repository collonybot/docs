# ✏️ Project Description

Your project description is shown when members interact with the bot. It helps onboard newcomers, clarify your mission, and build trust in your community.

1. In the setup menu, select **Project Description**.  
2. Enter a clear, concise overview of your project – what it is, what it does, and why people should care.  
3. Save your changes.
