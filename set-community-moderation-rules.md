# ⛏️ Set Moderation Rules

Clear rules are essential for collony to moderate effectively. While the bot already blocks spam, scams, and harmful content, every Web3 community has unique standards. Your rules guide collony on when to delete, mute, or ban members.

1. **Add Your Rules**
   Select **Community Moderation Rules**, paste your rules into the chat, and send them.

<Note>
  ✅ **collony team suggests starting with:**
  - No promoting of competing projects
  - No unverified airdrop or giveaway links
  - No impersonating admins or support
  - Limit excessive price speculation
  - Be respectful to members and admins
  - No personal attacks or toxic behavior: instant mute, repeated violations = ban
  - Moderation is final: repeated violations = ban
  - If a request is too specific or unclear, collony should ping human moderators **@x, @y, @z**
</Note>

2. **Save**
   Once the rules look good, choose **Save**. collony will confirm when they’re active.
3. **Update Anytime**
   Rules can be edited or expanded anytime – just send the new version, and collony will switch immediately.

<Tip>
  Tip: Tailor rules to your community’s culture. Some groups are English-only, others allow multiple languages. Some restrict stickers, GIFs, or videos, while others allow them freely. Adjust over time – especially if the bot feels too strict or too lenient.
