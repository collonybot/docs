# Set Community Moderation Rules

A clear ruleset is essential for collony to moderate effectively. While collony comes with built-in protections against spam, scams, and harmful behaviour, every Web3 community has its own standards. Defining your rules helps collony decide when to delete, mute, or ban with more accuracy.

1. **Add Your Rules**

   Select **Community Moderation Rules**, paste your rules into the chat, and send them.

> **âœ… collony team suggests beginning with:**
>
> - No promoting of competing projects
> - No unverified airdrop or giveaway links
> - No impersonating admins or support
> - Limit excessive price speculation
> - Be respectful to members and admins
> - No personal attacks or toxic behaviour: instant mute, repeated violations = ban
> - Moderation is final: repeated violations = ban
> - If a request is too specific or unclear, collony community mod should ping the chat moderators **@x, @y, @z** for assistance

2. **Save**

   Choose **Save** when the rules look good, collony will confirm once theyâ€™re active.
3. **Update Anytime**

   Rules can be edited or expanded anytime â€“ just send the new version, and collony will use it right away.

> **ðŸ’¡ Tip:** **Community Moderation Rules** should reflect your communityâ€™s culture. For example, some groups are English-only, while others allow multiple languages. Some communities restrict stickers, GIFs, or videos, while others allow them freely. Adjust the rules over time â€“ especially if the bot is either too strict or not strict enough in handling unwanted behaviour.
