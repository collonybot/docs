# 📚 Add Knowledge Base

The knowledge base powers collony’s responses. By adding FAQs, key details, and links, you help the bot give accurate answers and reduce repetitive questions in your community.

1. In the setup menu, select **Knowledge Base**.

2. Add your project information or FAQs to help collony answer community questions more effectively.
3. Don’t forget to include your team’s handles, so the bot can tag them when a request is too specific or unclear (e.g. _“@x, @y, @z”_).
4. Save to activate.
