# Step 6: Add Project Description

A short description helps new members quickly understand your project. Keep it to 2‚Äì3 sentences: state the purpose, main goals, and who it‚Äôs for.

1. **Add Description**

   Select **Project Description**, paste your text into the chat, and send it.
2. **Save**

   Choose **Save** when the description looks good.
3. **Confirm**

   collony will confirm once your description is updated.

  **Tip:** Keep it short, clear, and welcoming - it should highlight your vision while making newcomers feel oriented. If you ever want to update it, just paste a new description and send it.
