# 🏗️ In-Bot Setup Menu

After adding collony AI to your groups and starting the bot, you’ll enter the **in-bot setup**.\
This menu acts as your **control panel** – where you connect your community group, link your dashboard group, and adjust all core settings. On this page, we’ll walk through each option so you know exactly where to navigate.

1. **Open Channel Setup**\
   Select **Channel Setup** from the menu. Both your **community group** and **dashboard group** will be listed.

2. **Select Your Community Group**\
   Choose your primary community group (not the dashboard). You’ll then be presented with the configuration menu for that group.
