# Step 8: Set Community Moderation Rules

A clear ruleset is essential for collony to moderate effectively. While collony comes with built-in protections against spam, scams, and harmful behaviour, every Web3 community has its own standards. Defining your rules helps collony decide when to delete, mute, or ban with more accuracy.

1. **Add Your Rules**
    
    Select **Community Moderation Rules**, paste your rules into the chat, and send them.

    **collony team suggests beginning with:**
    
    - No promoting of competing projects
    - No unverified airdrop or giveaway links
    - No impersonating admins or support
    - Limit excessive price speculation
    - Be respectful to members and admins
    - No personal attacks or toxic behaviour: instant mute, repeated violations = ban
    - Moderation is final: repeated violations = ban
    - If a request is too specific or unclear, collony community mod should ping the chat moderators **@x, @y, @z** for assistance

**Tip:** **Community Moderation Rules** should reflect your community‚Äôs culture. For example, some groups are English-only, while others allow multiple languages. Some communities restrict stickers, GIFs, or videos, while others allow them freely. Adjust the rules over time ‚Äì especially if the bot is either too strict or not strict enough in handling unwanted behaviour.
