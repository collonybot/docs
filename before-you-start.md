# 🏎️  Before You Start

Before setting up the **collony AI Telegram moderator**, make sure you have the following ready:

1. **Telegram account** – either your own or your community manager’s.
2. **Admin rights** – the account must have full administrator permissions in the target group/channel.
3. **Target group/channel** – a Telegram group or channel where collony AI will operate (moderation \+ engagement).

<Tip>
  Tip: If you don’t have a Telegram community yet, create one first before inviting the collony bot.
