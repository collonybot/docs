# üèóÔ∏è In-Bot Setup Menu

Once collony AI is added to your groups and activated, you‚Äôll see the **setup menu**.\
This is your **control panel**: it connects your community group, links your dashboard group, and gives you access to all core configuration options.

1. **Open Channel Setup**\
   Select **Channel Setup** from the menu. Both your **community group** and **dashboard group** will be listed.

2. **Select Your Community Group**\
   Choose your primary community group (not the dashboard). You‚Äôll then be presented with the configuration menu for that group.
